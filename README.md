# Welcome to the Kanka Cookbook

This wiki is a repository of references, guides, tips and examples intended as a complement to the [Kanka Marketplace](https://marketplace.kanka.io/). It serves three primary purposes:

* Help Kanka users who are unfamiliar with CSS apply simple customizations to their campaign that are too specific to be featured as themes on the Marketplace, and learn the basics of CSS in the process.
* Help CSS enthusiasts become familiar with Kankaâ€™s styles and discover new tricks.
* Propose advanced tweaks and techniques to work around common problems and improve your own themes.
